# The Meta Design System
This repository provides a meta model that can be used to provide a customized design system by simply configuring and adopting your design system to the shared meta model. For the ease of use you can simply adjust a `.ts`-Configuration File while using a corresponding Design-Token Configuration. 

Please dive deep into the different concepts defined by us, as the understanding is mandatory to adopt your design system to work with our meta model.
